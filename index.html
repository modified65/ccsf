    <h3>MMSP 135A - Web Development for Designers I</h3>
    <p class="meeting-time">Monday-Thursday, 9:10am-12:00pm, Visual Arts 143</p>
    <p>This is an <em>introductory-level course</em> (the current online course description is inaccurate) focused on client-side web development using HTML and CSS. Lectures and course work cover production techniques for translating visual designs into standards-based web pages using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
    <p>At the completion of the course students will have an understanding of current and emerging web standards as they relate to front-end web development.</p>
    <p>Assignments will test knowledge of production techniques and concepts covered in class. Lectures will take place during the first third of each class with the remaining time spent applying the session's lesson towards assignments.</p>

Students will spend the last third of the course working on a personal web project.</p>
